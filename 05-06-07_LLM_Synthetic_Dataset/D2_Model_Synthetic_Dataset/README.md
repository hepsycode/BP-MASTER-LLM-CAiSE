# Large Language Model Synthetic Dataset

LLM synthetic dataset generation uses pre-trained LLM to create synthetic datasets that mimic real-world data. This method leverages the extensive knowledge and contextual understanding embedded in LLMs to generate data that can be used for training, validation, and testing of various ML models. Furthermore, LLM synthetic dataset generation effectively addresses the challenges of reducing the time and effort to generate BPMN models representing realistic designer behavior, and overcoming security concerns, privacy regulations, and industry restrictions. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of LLMs, our proposed approach provides a robust solution for creating high-quality, relevant, and secure datasets, thereby enhancing the development and performance of ML models.

In such a context, our work used GPT-4 Turbo, the professional version of GPT developed by OpenAI, as instances of the proposed LLM component in the proposed approach: 

GPT-4 is proprietary, meaning their underlying details and weights are not shared publicly. It is generally accessed via paid APIs or cloud services. We selected this LLM because it represents the best proprietary technologies according to LMSYS LeaderBoard.

The folder D2 contains the dataset generated with GPT-4 Turbo. Prompt schemas are added in word files.
